AUCTION TYPES
English Auctions: Open ascending-bid auctions where participants continue to bid until no higher bids are offered.
Dutch Auctions: Open descending-bid auctions where the price is gradually lowered until a buyer accepts the current price.
Sealed-Bid Auctions: Bidders submit one bid without knowledge of the othersâ€™ bids. Common types include first-price and second-price (Vickrey) auctions.
Combinatorial Auctions: Auctions where bidders can place bids on combinations of items rather than individual items, often used for complex goods like spectrum licenses.
